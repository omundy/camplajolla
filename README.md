## Deploy Astro to Github Pages

[Deploying](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/) to Github Pages is easy *if* all your resources are online. This was not my case.

### Gotchas

1. **Local data** - All my data came from a local MySQL database, so [none](https://github.com/withastro/github-pages) of the Github Pages [deploy scripts](https://github.com/withastro/action) worked (they couldn't get the data!)
1. **Deploying to a subpath** - the repo was not my main `omundy.github.io` but `omundy.github.io/camplajolla` which makes the root paths difficult to set up. (see this [postbuild](https://dev.to/jonas_duri/use-astro-with-gitlab-pages-or-github-pages-3eb7) article)
1. **Dotfiles** - Github Pages doesn't [automatically publish dotfiles](https://futurewebdesign.au/posts/gh-pages/). So the required `.nojekyll` file wasn't in the root directory of the build
1. **Managing builds** - W/o remote deployment I woud have build files in the main directory. The [gh-pages package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) automatically builds and deploys your site to a `gh-pages` branch. ([other uses](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f)) so it doesn't pollute the project. You can add the `--dotfiles` flag.



```bash
  # build, copy whole build to root
  "build": "astro build && rm -rf ../dist && mv ./dist ../dist",
  # build, copy individual to root
  "build": "astro build && cp -R ./dist/{_astro,about,assets,collection,defensonomy,404.html,index.html,manifest_*,robots.txt,site.webmanifest} ../",
  ```

1. Mark output as static in config `output: "static"`
1. Install `npm install gh-pages -D`
1. Add these to your package.json
    1. `npm run dev` - Start dev server `localhost:4321`
    1. `npm run build`  - Build static site to `./dist/` and copies git files
    1. `npm run deploy` - uses gh-pages package to publish to gh-pages branch, includes dotfiles

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "astro build && cp ./{.gitattributes,.gitignore} ./dist",
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist --branch gh-pages --dotfiles"
    }
}    
```
